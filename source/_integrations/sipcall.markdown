Ever wanted to ring a phone and hang up as a form of notification?
Use this simple integration with your local or cloud-based SIP account.

**Note:** This integration is still very rudimentary.
It works when used with a local FritzBox as a SIP registrar, but is known
to have issues with cloud-based registrars.
Let us know if you are facing issues or want to extend it.

## Notifications

The `sipcall` platform allows you to call a SIP phone from Home Assistant.

To enable file notifications in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: sipdoorbell
    platform: sipcall
    uri_from: sip:doorbell@192.168.0.1
    uri_via: 192.168.0.1
    uri_to: sip:1234@192.168.0.1
    username: doorbell
    password: EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
  required: false
  default: notify
  type: string
uri_from:
